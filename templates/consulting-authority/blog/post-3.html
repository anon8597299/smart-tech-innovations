    <article class="article-body">
      <p>Revenue growth gets all the attention, but margin improvement is often the higher-leverage move for a {{SUBURB}} business. A business turning over $2 million at 8% net margin makes $160,000. The same business turning over $2 million at 14% net margin makes $280,000 — an extra $120,000 in profit without a single new customer. Margin is the quality of revenue, and for most businesses there are more margin improvement opportunities than they realise. Here are the five levers that matter most.</p>

      <h2>Lever 1: Pricing</h2>
      <p>Pricing is the single highest-leverage margin improvement available to most {{SUBURB}} businesses, and it is the most underused. The reason is psychological — raising prices feels risky, because the downside (lost clients) is visible and the upside (higher margins per client) is less immediately obvious.</p>
      <p>The data, however, is fairly consistent. For service businesses with strong relationships and clear value delivery, price increases of 10–20% typically result in losing fewer than 10% of clients — meaning the net revenue impact is positive, and the margin impact is substantial. A consulting practice billing 50 clients at $2,000 per month that raises prices to $2,200 and loses 3 clients goes from $100,000 monthly revenue at some margin to $104,600 at a meaningfully higher margin per client.</p>
      <p>Before raising prices, articulate your value clearly and ensure your service quality and communication justify the increase. Price increases land best when they are framed around additional value or investment in quality, not simply cost recovery.</p>

      <h2>Lever 2: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)</h2>
      <p>For businesses that sell products or have variable delivery costs, even modest reductions in COGS compound significantly across volume. A product business with $1.5 million in product revenue and 55% gross margin has $825,000 in gross profit. If that gross margin improves to 60% — through better supplier terms, more efficient production, or product mix optimisation — gross profit increases to $900,000 with no change in revenue.</p>
      <p>Lever points to examine: supplier payment terms and volume discounts; waste and shrinkage in physical products; subcontractor rates for service businesses; time overruns in fixed-price projects. Most businesses have at least one material COGS inefficiency they haven't formally addressed.</p>

      <h2>Lever 3: Overhead Rationalisation</h2>
      <p>Overhead tends to accumulate incrementally — a new software subscription here, an upgraded space there, a support role that was necessary once but outlived its original purpose. The problem is that overhead rarely decreases organically; it has to be actively reviewed.</p>
      <p>A useful exercise is a zero-based overhead review: for every fixed cost, ask "Would we buy this today at this price?" Some costs survive that question easily. Others — legacy software subscriptions, unused space, redundant third-party services — often don't. For a business with $300,000 in annual overhead, a disciplined review that identifies 10–15% reduction saves $30,000–$45,000 in net profit with no impact on revenue.</p>

      <h2>Lever 4: Team Productivity</h2>
      <p>For service businesses, team productivity is a direct margin driver. If a team of ten generates $1.8 million in revenue, average revenue per person is $180,000. If process improvement, better tooling, or clearer role design increases that to $200,000 per person, the same team generates $2 million in revenue at similar wage cost — with the margin improvement flowing directly to the bottom line.</p>
      <p>The most common productivity inhibitors in growing {{SUBURB}} businesses: unclear priorities, excessive administrative overhead, poor handoff processes between team members, and rework caused by unclear briefing or quality standards. None of these require expensive technology — they require process clarity and management attention.</p>

      <h2>Lever 5: Customer Mix</h2>
      <p>Not all revenue is equal. A $50,000 annual client who requires minimal support, pays on time, and renews reliably is worth significantly more than a $70,000 client who requires constant hand-holding, disputes invoices, and churns after 18 months. Margin analysis by customer segment often reveals that a minority of clients — frequently the loudest and most demanding — contribute disproportionately low margin.</p>
      <p>This does not mean firing all difficult clients immediately. It means understanding your margin by customer and using that information to guide acquisition focus, pricing decisions, and relationship investment. Over time, intentionally shifting toward higher-margin client profiles improves profitability without requiring revenue growth.</p>

      <p><strong>{{BUSINESS_NAME}}</strong> works with {{SUBURB}} businesses to identify and execute the margin improvements that are specific to their situation. The levers above apply broadly, but the priority and approach depends on your numbers, your industry, and where you are in the business cycle. If you'd like to understand where your best margin opportunity lies, we'd welcome a conversation.</p>
