      <h1>Autumn/Winter 2026 Fashion Trends: What to Look For at {{BUSINESS_NAME}}</h1>
      <p class="meta">By {{BUSINESS_NAME}} &middot; {{SUBURB}}, {{STATE}} &middot; February 2026</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-body">
      <p>The fashion calendar has shifted, and the trends emerging for autumn/winter 2026 feel genuinely considered — a response, perhaps, to years of maximalism and noise. This season is defined by warmth, texture, and a commitment to pieces that work hard in a real wardrobe. Here are the five key directions we are watching at {{BUSINESS_NAME}}, and how to wear them.</p>

      <h2><span class="trend-number">1</span> Earthy Tones</h2>
      <p>The colour palette for autumn/winter 2026 draws from the ground up: terracotta, burnt sienna, deep ochre, olive, mushroom, and warm chocolate browns. These are colours with presence — grounded, rich, and flattering across a wide range of complexions — but without the loud statement of a primary colour palette.</p>
      <p><strong>How to wear it:</strong> The strength of this palette lies in tonal dressing — layering different earthy shades from the same family for a cohesive, pulled-together look without strict colour-matching. Pair a caramel knit with chocolate wide-leg trousers and a terracotta scarf. Or ground a single earthy piece — say an ochre coat — against clean neutrals like cream, ivory, or stone.</p>
      <p><strong>What we have in store:</strong> Look for our autumn arrivals in warm terracottas and olive tones, particularly in knitwear and outerwear. These are pieces designed to earn their space in your wardrobe for seasons to come.</p>

      <h2><span class="trend-number">2</span> Textured Layers</h2>
      <p>Texture is doing the heavy lifting this season in place of pattern or embellishment. Bouclé, ribbed knit, corduroy, brushed wool, shearling, and velvet are all prominent — materials that invite touch and reward close attention in a way that smooth, synthetic fabrics simply do not.</p>
      <p><strong>How to wear it:</strong> Layering is key, but the trick is contrast: a smooth silk blouse under a chunky bouclé jacket, or a fine-rib turtleneck under a brushed wool coat. Mixing textures at different scales creates visual interest without relying on colour or print. Keep the palette tight and let the materials do the talking.</p>
      <p><strong>What we have in store:</strong> We have made texture a priority in this season's buying — from mid-weight bouclé blazers to richly ribbed knitwear. Come in and feel the difference.</p>

      <h2><span class="trend-number">3</span> Relaxed Tailoring</h2>
      <p>The structured, rigid suiting of previous decades has given way to something more wearable — tailoring that retains its polish but allows for genuine movement and comfort. Oversized blazers with dropped shoulders, wide-leg trousers with a gentle drape, and suit separates worn as everyday pieces rather than formal uniforms define the look.</p>
      <p><strong>How to wear it:</strong> The beauty of relaxed tailoring is its versatility. A wide-leg trouser looks equally right with a casual knit and trainers as it does with a structured blouse and heeled mule. The blazer becomes a jacket over a midi dress, or a layer over knitwear for a deliberately mismatched, considered aesthetic. Lean into the looseness — proportion is everything.</p>
      <p><strong>What we have in store:</strong> Our tailoring edit for autumn/winter focuses on pieces you can actually reach for every day — blazers and trousers in wool-blend fabrics that hold their shape without feeling stiff.</p>

      <h2><span class="trend-number">4</span> Statement Boots</h2>
      <p>Footwear is the defining accessory of autumn/winter 2026, and boots in particular are having a strong moment. The key shapes are the knee-high with a modest block heel (functional but impactful), the wide-shaft Chelsea boot in leather or suede, and the lug-sole ankle boot that nods to utility fashion without abandoning elegance.</p>
      <p><strong>How to wear it:</strong> Knee-high boots work beautifully under a midi skirt or dress, or over straight-leg jeans for a polished off-duty look. The Chelsea boot is perhaps the most versatile option — equally at home with tailored trousers, wide-leg denim, or a casual dress. If you are investing in one pair of boots this season, a quality leather Chelsea in a neutral — tan, black, or a warm brown — will outlast the season by years.</p>
      <p><strong>What we have in store:</strong> Ask our team about our current footwear edit — we have curated a tight selection of this season's strongest boot shapes with wearability and quality at the forefront.</p>

      <h2><span class="trend-number">5</span> Minimalist Accessories</h2>
      <p>The maximalist accessory moment — stacked jewellery, logo-heavy bags, layered chains — is softening. In its place: quiet precision. Understated gold jewellery in sculptural shapes, structured bags in one quality material, fine leather belts used to define proportion, and scarves worn simply as a single deliberate gesture.</p>
      <p><strong>How to wear it:</strong> Choose one accessory as the focal point rather than competing for attention across the whole outfit. A single architectural ring, a quality leather tote, a fine chain necklace at the right length — restraint is the point. When everything is considered and nothing is excess, the result reads as confidence rather than effort.</p>
      <p><strong>What we have in store:</strong> Our accessories selection this season reflects this pared-back direction — look for clean lines, quality materials, and pieces that work across multiple outfits rather than anchoring just one look.</p>

      <p>The threads connecting all five of these trends are quality, considered buying, and longevity. Autumn/winter 2026 is a season for pieces that earn their place — and at {{BUSINESS_NAME}} in {{SUBURB}}, that is exactly how we approach every buying decision.
