    <article class="article-body">
      <p>The business owners who pay the least tax legally aren't the ones who scramble through receipts in June — they're the ones who think about tax throughout the year. Good tax planning is not about tricks or loopholes; it's about understanding which rules apply to your business, keeping clean records, and making deliberate decisions at the right time. For {{SUBURB}} small business owners heading into the second half of the 2025–26 financial year, here's what deserves your attention.</p>

      <h2>Keep Business and Personal Expenses Separate</h2>
      <p>This is foundational, and yet it remains one of the most common problems we see when new clients bring us their records. If you run a sole trader business and use a personal bank account for business transactions, you are making your own life significantly harder — and creating real risk of either missing legitimate deductions or inadvertently claiming personal expenses.</p>
      <p>Open a dedicated business bank account if you haven't. It costs almost nothing and it makes your BAS, tax return, and cashflow visibility dramatically cleaner. The ATO is sophisticated in detecting mixed-use accounts and sole traders are a segment they actively audit. A clean separation protects you.</p>

      <h2>Understand What You Can Claim</h2>
      <p>The golden rule for business deductions is that an expense must be incurred in the course of earning assessable income. Beyond that, the range of legitimately claimable expenses for a typical {{SUBURB}} small business is broad:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Home office:</strong> If you genuinely work from home, you can claim a portion of occupancy costs (interest or rent, utilities, internet) based on the floor area and hours used. The ATO's fixed-rate method (67c per hour) is simpler but often less optimal.</li>
        <li><strong>Vehicle:</strong> Log book or cents-per-kilometre. If business use is significant, a log book is almost always worth the effort — the deduction can be substantial.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment and technology:</strong> Computers, phones, software subscriptions, tools specific to your industry — all claimable to the extent of business use.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional development and subscriptions:</strong> Industry memberships, journals, online courses relevant to your current business activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Bank fees, accounting fees, legal fees</strong> related to the business.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What you cannot claim: personal expenses, capital expenditure (handled separately), and expenses incurred before the business started generating income.</p>

      <h2>Small Business Tax Offsets and Concessions in 2026</h2>
      <p>The instant asset write-off allows eligible small businesses to immediately deduct the cost of new or second-hand assets (up to the relevant threshold) in the year they are first used or installed ready for use, rather than depreciating over several years. This can significantly reduce your taxable income in a high-investment year — but timing matters. An asset purchased and put into service before 30 June counts for this financial year; one purchased but not yet operational does not.</p>
      <p>Base rate entities (companies with an aggregated turnover under $50 million) continue to benefit from the lower 25% company tax rate. Sole traders and partnerships are taxed at individual marginal rates, which is why income-splitting strategies (where legally available) can be worth discussing with your accountant.</p>

      <h2>Super Contributions Before June 30</h2>
      <p>Superannuation contributions made to a complying super fund before 30 June are tax-deductible for businesses — including for the business owner personally, subject to caps. For the 2025–26 financial year, the concessional contributions cap is $30,000 per person. This includes employer SGC contributions made on behalf of employees.</p>
      <p>As a self-employed person or sole trader, you can also make personal super contributions and claim a deduction — provided you lodge a "Notice of Intent to Claim" with your fund before lodging your tax return. This is a genuinely underused strategy that can reduce your personal tax bill meaningfully if you have the cash available before year-end.</p>

      <h2>Don't Forget GST and BAS</h2>
      <p>If your business has a turnover of $75,000 or more, GST registration is compulsory. Below that threshold, it's optional (but may still be worth registering depending on your client base and input tax credits). Once registered, you must lodge BAS — quarterly for most small businesses, monthly if your turnover is higher.</p>
      <p>Cash basis accounting (where you report GST based on when you actually receive or pay money) is simpler for most small businesses than accruals basis (reporting based on invoice date). Most accounting software will handle this automatically once configured correctly. The key is consistency — don't mix methods between periods.</p>

      <h2>Get Professional Advice Early — Not Just at Tax Time</h2>
      <p>The most expensive time to call an accountant is June. By then, the year's transactions are done, elections are closed, and the only option is to report accurately. The most valuable time to call is mid-year or at a business transition point — taking on staff, restructuring, purchasing significant assets, or reviewing your entity structure.</p>
      <p>A proactive conversation in February or March can result in real tax savings before June 30. The same conversation in July is too late for that financial year.</p>
