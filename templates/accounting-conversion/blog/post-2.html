      <h1>BAS Lodgement Guide for {{SUBURB}} Business Owners</h1>

    <article class="article-body">
      <p>For many {{SUBURB}} small business owners, the Business Activity Statement (BAS) is a source of ongoing confusion and low-level dread. Quarterly deadlines roll around, the forms look complex, and there's always a nagging uncertainty about whether you've included everything correctly. This guide aims to take the mystery out of BAS — what it is, when it's due, what goes in it, and the mistakes that trip up otherwise careful business owners.</p>

      <h2>What Is a BAS?</h2>
      <p>A Business Activity Statement is the form you lodge with the ATO to report and pay your tax obligations. Depending on your business, this may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>GST</strong> — the goods and services tax you've collected from customers, minus the GST credits you've paid on business purchases</li>
        <li><strong>PAYG withholding</strong> — tax withheld from employee wages</li>
        <li><strong>PAYG income tax instalments</strong> — prepayments toward your annual income tax liability</li>
        <li><strong>Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) instalments</strong> — if applicable</li>
        <li><strong>Luxury car tax</strong> and <strong>wine equalisation tax</strong> — if relevant to your industry</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For most {{SUBURB}} small businesses, BAS is primarily about GST and, if you have employees, PAYG withholding. The other items apply in more specific circumstances.</p>

      <h2>Who Needs to Lodge a BAS?</h2>
      <p>You are required to lodge a BAS if you are registered for GST. GST registration is compulsory once your business has an annual turnover of $75,000 or more (or $150,000 for non-profit organisations). Below this threshold, registration is voluntary — though there are situations where it makes sense to register early, particularly if you have significant input tax credits to claim.</p>
      <p>If you have employees, you will also be lodging BAS (or an IAS — Instalment Activity Statement) to report and pay PAYG withholding, even if you are not GST registered.</p>

      <h2>Quarterly Deadlines</h2>
      <p>Most small businesses lodge BAS quarterly. The standard due dates for 2025–26 are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Q1 (July–September):</strong> 28 October</li>
        <li><strong>Q2 (October–December):</strong> 28 February</li>
        <li><strong>Q3 (January–March):</strong> 28 April</li>
        <li><strong>Q4 (April–June):</strong> 28 July</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you lodge through a registered BAS agent or tax agent (like {{BUSINESS_NAME}}), you are typically granted an extended due date — usually an additional 4 weeks. This is a significant practical benefit of working with a registered agent.</p>
      <p>Monthly lodgement applies if your GST turnover exceeds $20 million, and is also available as an option for businesses that prefer more frequent reconciliation.</p>

      <h2>What to Include in Your BAS</h2>
      <p>The core of your BAS is the GST calculation. You need to report:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>G1 — Total sales:</strong> All sales (including GST-free and input-taxed sales), not just taxable sales</li>
        <li><strong>G2 — Export sales:</strong> If applicable</li>
        <li><strong>G3 — Other GST-free sales:</strong> Including fresh food, medical services, education</li>
        <li><strong>G10 — Capital purchases:</strong> Business assets purchased during the period</li>
        <li><strong>G11 — Non-capital purchases:</strong> Day-to-day business expenses that include GST</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The resulting figure is either a GST payment to the ATO or a refund. Your accounting software (Xero, MYOB, QuickBooks) should populate most of this automatically if your transactions are categorised correctly.</p>

      <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <p>The errors we see most frequently when {{SUBURB}} businesses come to us with BAS problems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Claiming GST on GST-free expenses</strong> — wages, bank interest, insurance stamp duty, and some professional services don't include GST</li>
        <li><strong>Omitting private use adjustments</strong> — if you use a vehicle or phone for both business and personal use, you can only claim the business portion</li>
        <li><strong>Not reconciling to your bank account</strong> — always cross-check your BAS figures against actual bank transactions before lodging</li>
        <li><strong>Forgetting PAYG withholding</strong> — employee wages are a significant compliance obligation that must be reported even if the net GST result is nil</li>
        <li><strong>Lodging with uncategorised transactions</strong> — transactions sitting as "uncategorised" in your accounting software mean your figures are incomplete</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Penalties for Late Lodgement</h2>
      <p>The ATO does not give informal extensions. If you miss your BAS due date without a formal deferral in place, a failure to lodge (FTL) penalty applies. The penalty is calculated as one penalty unit (currently $330) per 28-day period (or part thereof) that the lodgement is overdue, up to a maximum of five penalty units for small businesses. So a BAS that is two months late can cost you $660 — on top of any interest on late payment.</p>
      <p>The ATO also charges the general interest charge (GIC) on any unpaid amount from the due date. GIC rates are set quarterly and are currently above 11% per annum — higher than most business borrowing costs.</p>
