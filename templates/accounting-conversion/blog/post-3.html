      <h1>Signs You Need an Accountant: A Guide for {{SUBURB}} Businesses</h1>
      <p class="meta">By {{BUSINESS_NAME}} &nbsp;·&nbsp; {{SUBURB}}, {{STATE}} &nbsp;·&nbsp; Business Advice</p>
    </div>

    <article class="article-body">
      <p>Most small business owners start out handling their own books. When you're just starting, the transactions are simple, the volume is low, and the cost of professional accounting feels hard to justify. That calculation changes as a business grows — and it usually changes before most owners realise it. This guide covers six clear signs that DIY accounting has reached its limits for your {{SUBURB}} business, and what a professional accountant can actually do for you beyond just lodging your tax return.</p>

      <h2>Sign 1: Your Revenue Is Growing Steadily</h2>
      <p>Once a business passes around $200,000–$300,000 in annual revenue, the complexity of tax planning, deduction optimisation, and entity structure typically starts to outweigh the cost of professional accounting. At this level, decisions about superannuation, vehicle usage, home office claims, trust distributions, and asset purchases all have meaningful tax consequences — consequences that a general-purpose accounting app won't alert you to.</p>
      <p>Growing businesses also tend to reinvest heavily, and doing so in a tax-effective way — timing asset purchases, managing income splitting, understanding the interplay between business income and personal tax — requires someone who knows your numbers and the current rules.</p>

      <h2>Sign 2: You've Taken On Your First Employee</h2>
      <p>Employing staff introduces a layer of complexity that most business owners underestimate: PAYG withholding, superannuation guarantee, Single Touch Payroll reporting, payroll tax (once you exceed the relevant state threshold), long service leave obligations, and Fair Work compliance. Getting any of these wrong creates liability that can reach back years.</p>
      <p>The ATO is particularly active in pursuing superannuation guarantee non-compliance. Unpaid SG attracts the Superannuation Guarantee Charge, which is calculated on a broader base than ordinary SG and is not tax-deductible. A payroll error that seems minor at the time can become expensive quickly.</p>

      <h2>Sign 3: You're Approaching the GST Threshold</h2>
      <p>GST registration is compulsory once your turnover reaches $75,000. But many business owners don't realise they've crossed the threshold until months later — by which point they may owe backdated GST to the ATO without having charged it to customers. This is a real and painful scenario that a proactive accountant helps you avoid by monitoring your revenue trajectory.</p>
      <p>Once registered, BAS lodgement, GST accounting, and input tax credit claims all require consistent processes. Setting these up correctly from the start saves significant rework later.</p>

      <h2>Sign 4: Your Deductions Are Getting Complex</h2>
      <p>Vehicle use. Home office. Equipment used partly for business. Travel with a personal component. Meals that were technically client entertainment. Overseas expenses. Each of these has specific ATO rules, record-keeping requirements, and limitations. Claiming incorrectly — in either direction — costs you money or creates audit risk.</p>
      <p>The ATO's data-matching capabilities have expanded significantly. They receive data from banks, share registries, online platforms, Airbnb, Uber, and many others. Deduction claims that are inconsistent with this data are flagged automatically. An accountant who understands what's defensible and what's marginal is genuinely valuable here.</p>

      <h2>Sign 5: You've Received ATO Correspondence or Had Queries</h2>
      <p>If the ATO has written to you — even for something that seems routine, like a notice about data discrepancies or a request to verify an amount — this is a sign you need professional representation. ATO audits, reviews, and queries are time-consuming, stressful, and carry real financial risk if handled poorly. A registered tax agent handles all ATO correspondence on your behalf, knows the right language, and understands what concessions and objection rights apply to your situation.</p>

      <h2>Sign 6: You're Spending Mental Energy on Bookkeeping Instead of Your Business</h2>
      <p>This is the sign that's hardest to quantify but often most important. If you are spending weekend hours reconciling bank statements, feeling anxious about whether you've categorised something correctly, or deferring financial decisions because you're not sure of the tax consequences — you are paying a real cost. That time and mental energy has an opportunity cost in your business.</p>
      <p>Good accounting is not just about compliance. It's about having clear, timely financial information that helps you make better decisions — pricing, cashflow, hiring, investment. Most business owners who engage a professional accountant say, within twelve months, that they should have done it sooner.</p>
