    <article class="article-body">
      <p>Of all the decisions that go into planning a wedding in {{SUBURB}}, choosing the venue is the most consequential. It sets the tone for every other element — catering, styling, photography, guest experience — and it's the decision that's hardest to change once it's made. A wedding venue that genuinely fits your vision, your numbers, and your practical constraints makes everything else easier. A mismatch makes everything else harder. This guide walks through the questions that matter most, in the order you should be thinking about them.</p>

      <h2>Start with Capacity and Guest Numbers</h2>
      <p>Your guest list and your venue capacity need to align — but the relationship is more nuanced than just "will everyone fit?" Consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimum numbers:</strong> Many venues have minimum catering spends or guest counts, particularly for Saturday dates. A venue built for 200 guests will feel hollow for a 60-person wedding, and the food and beverage minimum may be unachievable.</li>
        <li><strong>Maximum capacity at different configurations:</strong> A venue might hold 200 for a cocktail style event but only 120 with a formal seated layout. Confirm the capacity for your specific format.</li>
        <li><strong>Flow between spaces:</strong> Will guests move between ceremony and reception spaces? What are the logistics of that transition, and how does it affect timing?</li>
        <li><strong>Children:</strong> If you're inviting families with young children, is there a suitable area for them? Noisy or restless children in a formal space can affect the atmosphere for everyone.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Catering — In-House vs External</h2>
      <p>Venues typically fall into two categories: those with in-house catering and those that allow or require external caterers. Each has genuine advantages and limitations.</p>
      <p><strong>In-house catering</strong> means the venue's kitchen and staff handle food and service. The advantages are logistical simplicity, established team familiarity with the space, and usually more competitive pricing on beverage packages. The limitation is less flexibility — you are choosing from their menu and their service style, and the quality reflects that specific kitchen's capabilities.</p>
      <p><strong>External caterers</strong> allow you to bring in exactly the food style you want — whether that's a specific cuisine, a well-regarded local chef, or a particular dietary focus. The trade-off is coordination complexity: the caterer needs to understand the venue's kitchen facilities, bump-in arrangements, and service logistics. Always confirm what kitchen infrastructure is available and what the caterer requires before assuming this option is straightforward.</p>
      <p>Key questions: Is there a beverage package, or can you bring your own alcohol (BYO)? If BYO, is there a corkage fee? Are there minimum spends per person? Is there a separate charge for staffing?</p>

      <h2>The Question of Wet Weather</h2>
      <p>Outdoor ceremonies are genuinely beautiful — and {{SUBURB}}'s climate can be wonderful. But every outdoor wedding in Australia needs a credible wet weather plan. "We'll just push the ceremony inside" sounds simple; in practice, it requires that the indoor space is large enough to accommodate the ceremony properly, that the setup can be reconfigured in the time available, and that the venue has done this before without it being a disaster.</p>
      <p>Questions to ask: What is the wet weather backup and how does it work in practice? Has the venue used it in the last year and what happened? Is there an additional cost for the backup space or reconfiguration? How much notice do you need to make the call — and who makes it? A venue that is vague about wet weather contingency is a venue that has not managed it well in the past.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility and Parking</h2>
      <p>Accessibility is frequently an afterthought until someone raises it the week before the wedding. If you have elderly guests, guests with mobility limitations, or anyone using a wheelchair or walking frame, confirm the following before you book:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step-free access from the entrance through to both the ceremony and reception spaces</li>
        <li>Accessible bathroom facilities on the same level as the event spaces</li>
        <li>Accessible parking spaces close to the entrance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Parking matters more than couples often anticipate. A venue that requires guests to park remotely and walk significantly — particularly in formal attire, late at night, or in inclement weather — creates logistical frustration. Confirm available parking, whether it's on-site or nearby, and whether there are any restrictions or cost.</p>

      <h2>Coordinator vs DIY</h2>
      <p>A dedicated on-the-day coordinator — provided by the venue or hired separately — is one of the most consistently undervalued elements of a wedding. What a coordinator saves you on the day is significant: they manage vendor arrival and setup, handle the ceremony run sheet, liaise with the kitchen on service timing, manage the transition between event phases, and troubleshoot the inevitable small problems before you or your guests notice them.</p>
      <p>Without coordination, those responsibilities fall to someone — usually a family member or the partner of a bridal party member who has now become an unpaid events manager for the day. Many couples only realise the value of a coordinator after they've spoken to someone whose wedding lacked one.</p>

      <h2>Questions to Ask Every Venue Before Booking</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Is the venue exclusively ours for the day, or are there other events running simultaneously?</li>
        <li>What time can we access the venue for setup, and when must we be completely cleared?</li>
        <li>What is included in the hire fee, and what are the common add-ons that couples end up paying?</li>
        <li>What is the cancellation and postponement policy?</li>
        <li>Do you hold a liquor licence, and what are the service hours?</li>
        <li>What music and noise restrictions apply, and what is the cut-off time for amplified music?</li>
        <li>Are there preferred suppliers we're required to use, or can we bring our own?</li>
      </ul>
