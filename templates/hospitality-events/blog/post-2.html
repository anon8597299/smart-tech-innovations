      <h1>Corporate Event Planning in {{SUBURB}}: What to Look For in a Venue</h1>
      <p class="meta">By {{BUSINESS_NAME}} &nbsp;·&nbsp; {{SUBURB}}, {{STATE}} &nbsp;·&nbsp; Corporate Events</p>
    </div>

    <article class="article-body">
      <p>A corporate event that runs smoothly is invisible — attendees focus on the content, the networking, and the experience. A corporate event that doesn't run smoothly is very visible indeed. The difference is usually not the keynote speaker or the canapés; it's the venue and the operational decisions that surrounded it. Whether you're planning a board retreat, a client function, a product launch, or an all-staff conference, the venue selection is the single decision with the longest downstream impact on everything else. Here's what to prioritise when evaluating venues in {{SUBURB}}.</p>

      <h2>AV and Technology Requirements</h2>
      <p>AV failure is the most consistent source of frustration at corporate events. Presenters can't connect their laptop, the screen is positioned where half the room can't see it, microphones feed back, the videoconference connection is unstable. These problems are almost always preventable, but they require proactive assessment — not assumptions.</p>
      <p>When evaluating a venue, confirm:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What AV equipment is included in the hire (projector, screen, PA system, microphones, lectern)?</li>
        <li>What is the internet connection speed and reliability, and is it dedicated to the event or shared with other guests?</li>
        <li>Is there an on-site AV technician available, or do you need to hire one externally?</li>
        <li>What are the connection options for presenter laptops — HDMI, USB-C, DisplayPort?</li>
        <li>Has the venue run hybrid events (in-room plus videoconference) before, and what platform do they support?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For any event where presentation quality matters, a site visit that specifically tests the AV setup — not just a verbal assurance — is worth the time.</p>

      <h2>Catering for Corporate Audiences</h2>
      <p>Corporate catering expectations have shifted. Attendees are better-informed about dietary requirements and less tolerant of one-size-fits-all menus. For any event of scale, confirm that the venue can genuinely accommodate: vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, halal, and common allergens. Ask to see how dietary alternatives are presented — isolated, clearly labelled options that don't make guests feel conspicuous are the standard to aim for.</p>
      <p>Meal timing within a corporate program is a planning detail that's frequently underestimated. A lunch break that runs 15 minutes over compresses the afternoon program or requires the schedule to be rebuilt in real time. Discuss with the venue how they manage service pace and what their experience is with maintaining timing in a multi-session format.</p>
      <p>Coffee and tea service matters more than it seems. A buffet station that runs dry before the morning session ends, or a post-lunch coffee service that's slow when you most need people alert, affects the energy of the room.</p>

      <h2>Layout Flexibility</h2>
      <p>Corporate events rarely fit a single configuration. A morning plenary requires theatre or classroom style. Post-lunch workshops might need smaller, breakout-room setups. An evening networking function is best suited to cocktail style with standing room and bar access. A venue that can flex between these — ideally in short transition windows — is significantly more valuable than one with a fixed layout.</p>
      <p>When assessing a venue, ask for the room dimensions and the various layout configurations they can support with specific capacities for each. Ask how long they need to turn a room around between configurations and whether their staff handle it or whether you need to provide your own. For multi-day events, the ability to leave a setup undisturbed overnight is worth confirming.</p>

      <h2>Accommodation and Transport</h2>
      <p>For interstate attendees, overnight guests, or multi-day events, proximity to accommodation is a meaningful factor in attendee experience. A venue that has on-site accommodation or a strong existing relationship with a nearby hotel reduces coordination overhead significantly and makes the transition from day sessions to evening dinners seamless.</p>
      <p>Transport from the nearest CBD or airport, and the ease of that journey for attendees arriving from different directions, affects attendance rates for events where people have a choice. Confirm car parking, public transport access, and whether the venue can assist with transport coordination for groups arriving simultaneously.</p>

      <h2>What Actually Impresses Attendees</h2>
      <p>Having worked across many corporate events, the elements that generate the most positive feedback from attendees are consistently: smooth transitions between sessions, food that is genuinely good rather than adequate, a venue coordinator who is proactive rather than reactive, comfortable seating (particularly for full-day formats), and reliable wifi. The elements that generate negative feedback are: AV problems, cold food, service delays at breaks, and a sense that the event is disorganised — which usually reflects the venue's operational standards rather than the content.</p>

      <h2>Common Mistakes in Corporate Event Planning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Booking without a site visit:</strong> Photos and brochures don't reveal acoustics, natural light quality, or the reality of traffic flow between spaces</li>
        <li><strong>Underestimating setup time:</strong> A full-day event with AV, catering, and materials requires several hours of venue access before attendees arrive</li>
        <li><strong>Not confirming exclusivity:</strong> Sharing a venue with another event on the same day affects noise, parking, lift access, and general professionalism</li>
        <li><strong>Skipping the rehearsal:</strong> Even a 30-minute AV and microphone check the morning of the event prevents the vast majority of technical problems</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring the end-of-event logistics:</strong> How does the venue handle pack-down? What happens to materials left overnight? Who is responsible for the space at the end of the hire period?</li>
      </ul>
