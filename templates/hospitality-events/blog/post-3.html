    <article class="article-body">
      <p>Signing a venue contract without asking the right questions first is one of the most common and costly mistakes event planners make. Most venues present well — the photos look great, the sales team is friendly, the price seems reasonable. The issues that cause real problems almost always live in the details that weren't discussed upfront: a noise curfew that ends at 10pm, a catering exclusivity clause that locks out your preferred supplier, a cancellation policy with no provisions for force majeure. These ten questions won't make you an events lawyer, but they will ensure you understand what you're actually agreeing to before you sign.</p>

      <h2>1. What Is the Confirmed Capacity for My Event Format?</h2>
      <p>Venue capacity figures are often cited for the most optimistic configuration — typically standing cocktail. Your event may require a different setup: formal seated dinner, theatre style, classroom, or a hybrid. Ask for the confirmed capacity for your specific format, not the headline number. Also ask whether this is the regulatory maximum or the comfortable maximum — a space that technically seats 180 but feels claustrophobic at that number is not a 180-person venue for practical purposes.</p>

      <h2>2. Is the Venue Exclusively Ours for the Booking Period?</h2>
      <p>Exclusivity has material implications for parking, noise, vendor access, and the overall atmosphere. If another event is running simultaneously in an adjacent space, will it affect noise levels in your room? Will parking be contested? Will your guests arrive to a venue that feels busy with someone else's event? Many venues operate multiple functions on the same day — this is not inherently a problem, but it should be discussed and understood before you commit.</p>

      <h2>3. What Are the Catering Arrangements?</h2>
      <p>This encompasses several sub-questions: Is catering exclusively in-house, or can you bring your own supplier? If in-house, is there a minimum spend per person? If external caterers are permitted, what are the kitchen access arrangements, and is there a venue hire fee component for using external suppliers? Is there a licensed bar, and can guests bring their own alcohol? If BYO, is there a corkage fee and what is the per-bottle charge?</p>
      <p>Catering exclusivity clauses in venue contracts are frequently missed because they are buried in the general terms rather than highlighted. Read the contract carefully, or ask directly: "Are we required to use your catering, and what happens if we want to bring an external caterer?"</p>

      <h2>4. What Are the Noise Restrictions and Music Curfew?</h2>
      <p>Noise restrictions vary dramatically between venues and between council zones. An outdoor venue may have a 10pm amplified music curfew. An indoor venue might have sound insulation that allows music until midnight but requires it to be at conversation level after 11pm. Bands have different noise profiles to DJs. Ask specifically: What time must amplified music cease? What time must all noise (including unamplified speeches) cease? Has the venue ever received a noise complaint, and what happened?</p>
      <p>For weddings and parties where music is central to the experience, this question is non-negotiable. Getting the answer after you've booked — and after you've engaged your band — is too late.</p>

      <h2>5. What Is the Cancellation and Postponement Policy?</h2>
      <p>Read this clause very carefully. Standard venue contracts typically require non-refundable deposits (often 20–30% of the total event value) and tiered cancellation fees based on proximity to the event date. Many clients are surprised to learn that cancelling two months out might cost them 50–75% of the total booking value.</p>
      <p>Also ask specifically about postponement provisions. Can you move a date without financial penalty if it's more than 12 months out? What happens if you need to change the date due to circumstances outside your control — illness, a significant family event, weather that makes the venue inaccessible? How the venue handles these situations tells you something important about how they operate generally.</p>

      <h2>6. What Insurance Do You Require, and What Does the Venue Carry?</h2>
      <p>Many venues now require clients to hold public liability insurance for the event. This is separate from the venue's own insurance. If you're booking through a corporate entity, your business may already have appropriate coverage; if you're an individual booking a private function, you may need to arrange event-specific cover. Ask what the minimum coverage requirement is and whether the venue can recommend a broker.</p>
      <p>Also ask what the venue's own insurance covers in the event of damage to your property, equipment failure, or an incident affecting a guest. Understanding the boundaries of liability — yours and theirs — before an incident is considerably more useful than understanding it after one.</p>

      <h2>7. What Are the Bump-In and Bump-Out Times?</h2>
      <p>Bump-in is the period before your event when you and your vendors can access the venue for setup. Bump-out is the period after the event for pack-down and clearing. These windows are often significantly shorter than clients expect, particularly at venues that run back-to-back events.</p>
      <p>For a wedding or large corporate event, you might need access from early afternoon for a 6pm start; your florist, AV technician, and caterer all need time in the space simultaneously. Ask what time vendors can arrive, whether there is a loading zone, and whether there are any restrictions on when specific vendors can access the space.</p>

      <h2>8. Is There a Dedicated Events Coordinator, and Who Is Our Contact on the Day?</h2>
      <p>The name in the contract and the person managing your event on the day are not always the same. Venue staff change, responsibilities shift, and sometimes the enthusiastic sales coordinator who was so helpful during the planning phase is not present on the day itself. Ask who specifically will be your on-site contact during the event, what their role is, and what their availability is from the start of bump-in to the end of bump-out.</p>

      <h2>9. What Parking and Transport Access Is Available?</h2>
      <p>How many car parks does the venue have, and are they exclusively available to your event? Is there street parking nearby and, if so, is it time-restricted? Is there disability access from the car park to the venue entrance? For evening events, is the area well-lit and does the venue have security or a doorman? For venues expecting guests who may have consumed alcohol, is there a safe and accessible taxi or rideshare drop-off zone?</p>

      <h2>10. What Is Included in the Hire Fee, and What Are the Common Add-Ons?</h2>
      <p>Venue hire fees often look competitive until you add up what's not included. Tables and chairs are sometimes extra. Linen may not be included. The use of the outdoor space might be a separate charge. AV equipment, staffing for setup and pack-down, security for after-hours events, cleaning — all of these can appear as line items that were not in the original quote. Ask for a complete list of what is and is not included, and ask specifically what the venue's typical clients end up paying in addition to the base hire fee.</p>

      <p>At <strong>{{BUSINESS_NAME}}</strong> in {{SUBURB}}, we answer every one of these questions openly as part of our standard enquiry process. We believe that a client who books with a clear understanding of exactly what they're getting is far more likely to have a great experience than one who discovers the details only after signing. We also don't have hidden add-ons — what you see in our packages is what you pay for.</p>
