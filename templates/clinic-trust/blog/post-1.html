      <h1>When to See a GP vs Wait It Out: A Guide for {{SUBURB}} Residents</h1>
      <p class="meta">By {{BUSINESS_NAME}} &nbsp;·&nbsp; {{SUBURB}}, {{STATE}} &nbsp;·&nbsp; Health Advice</p>
    </div>

    <article class="article-body">
      <p>Knowing when to book an appointment and when to rest at home is genuinely a skill — and one that most people are never taught. For {{SUBURB}} residents, the question comes up constantly: "Is this something I need to see a GP about, or am I fine to wait?" The stakes go in both directions. Waiting too long on a serious symptom can lead to complications. But booking a GP appointment for something that would resolve on its own within 48 hours adds pressure to an already stretched system — and costs you time and money.</p>

      <p>This guide is designed to help you make that call with more confidence. These are general guidelines, not medical advice. If you are ever genuinely unsure, call your clinic directly — most GP practices, including ours, have staff who can help you triage over the phone.</p>

      <h2>Symptoms That Need Same-Day Attention</h2>
      <p>Some symptoms should prompt you to call your GP and specifically request a same-day or urgent appointment. These are not emergencies that require an ambulance, but they need professional assessment within hours — not days.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chest tightness or pressure</strong> that is new, unexplained, or comes with shortness of breath</li>
        <li><strong>High fever above 39°C</strong>, particularly in children under two, adults over 65, or anyone who is immunocompromised</li>
        <li><strong>Sudden severe pain</strong> — particularly headache described as "the worst of your life", severe abdominal pain, or back pain with urinary symptoms</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty breathing</strong> that is new or worsening beyond your normal baseline</li>
        <li><strong>Signs of infection</strong> — rapidly spreading redness, warmth, or swelling around a wound or insect bite</li>
        <li><strong>Mental health crisis</strong> — thoughts of self-harm or significant deterioration that cannot wait for a scheduled appointment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you call, describe these symptoms clearly. A good GP clinic will prioritise you or direct you to the right care pathway.</p>

      <h2>Symptoms That Can Wait 1–3 Days</h2>
      <p>Many common presentations do not require urgent care, especially in otherwise healthy adults. These can generally wait for a regular appointment slot:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mild cold or flu symptoms</strong> — runny nose, sore throat, mild body aches — in a healthy adult with no underlying conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Minor skin rash</strong> that is not spreading rapidly, not on the face, and not associated with breathing difficulty</li>
        <li><strong>Recurring headaches</strong> that follow your usual pattern and have no new characteristics</li>
        <li><strong>Mild urinary symptoms</strong> in adult women without fever, back pain, or blood in urine</li>
        <li><strong>Medication refills</strong> for stable, ongoing conditions where you have enough supply to cover a few days</li>
        <li><strong>Minor sprains or strains</strong> with full movement and manageable pain</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This does not mean dismissing these concerns — it means there is time to book properly, prepare, and have a thorough appointment rather than a rushed urgent slot.</p>

      <h2>When to Go to Emergency (vs Your GP)</h2>
      <p>Your GP is not equipped to manage medical emergencies, and emergency departments are not designed for non-urgent presentations. Knowing the difference helps both you and the healthcare system.</p>
      <p><strong>Go straight to emergency (000 or nearest ED) for:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Suspected stroke — face drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty</li>
        <li>Suspected heart attack — chest pain, jaw pain, left arm pain with sweating</li>
        <li>Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)</li>
        <li>Loss of consciousness or unresponsiveness</li>
        <li>Seizures, especially a first-ever seizure</li>
        <li>Severe breathing difficulty or coughing up blood</li>
        <li>Serious injury — suspected fractures, deep lacerations, head injury with confusion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Emergency departments exist for genuine emergencies. For everything else, your GP can almost always provide better, more personalised care — usually faster than the wait at an ED.</p>

      <h2>Chronic Conditions — When Your GP Should Know</h2>
      <p>If you have a chronic condition — diabetes, hypertension, asthma, heart disease, or mental health conditions — the bar for contacting your GP should be lower than for someone without these conditions. Things worth booking for include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blood pressure readings consistently outside your normal range at home</li>
        <li>Noticeable side effects from a new or recently adjusted medication</li>
        <li>Blood sugar readings that are consistently elevated or erratic</li>
        <li>Worsening mental health symptoms, even if they feel manageable day-to-day</li>
        <li>Any new symptom that your specialist has told you to watch for</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Chronic condition management is one of the most valuable things a regular GP relationship provides. Don't wait for a crisis — check in regularly.</p>

      <h2>Making the Most of Your GP Appointment in {{SUBURB}}</h2>
      <p>Once you've decided to book, a little preparation goes a long way. GPs in busy clinics are working with limited time per patient, so helping them help you is worthwhile:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Write down your symptoms</strong> before you arrive — when they started, how they've changed, what makes them better or worse</li>
        <li><strong>Bring a current medication list</strong>, including any supplements, over-the-counter medications, or treatments from other practitioners</li>
        <li><strong>Be upfront about everything</strong> — GPs see thousands of patients and there is nothing that surprises them. Honest information leads to better care</li>
        <li><strong>Ask your questions directly</strong> — if you leave the appointment unsure what to do next, you haven't gotten the full value of the visit</li>
        <li><strong>Mention all your concerns</strong> at the start of the appointment, not just one — this helps your GP prioritise and manage time effectively</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When in doubt, the right answer is almost always to call your GP and let them help you decide. That's precisely what we are here for.</p>
