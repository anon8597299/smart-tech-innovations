      <h1>How to Choose a Licensed Tradie in {{SUBURB}}: What to Look For</h1>

    <div class="article-body">

      <p>Hiring a tradie is one of those decisions that feels straightforward until something goes wrong. In {{SUBURB}}, there is no shortage of people offering trade services — but not all of them are licensed, properly insured, or genuinely accountable to their customers. Choosing the wrong person can leave you with substandard work, no warranty, and in the worst cases, a liability problem if something they did causes injury or damage.</p>

      <p>The good news is that a few simple checks before you commit will protect you almost every time. Here is what to look for when hiring a tradie in {{SUBURB}}.</p>

      <h2>Always Check Their Licence</h2>
      <p>Trades including plumbing, electrical, gas fitting, and building work are legally required to be performed by a licensed contractor in {{STATE}}. A licence is not optional — it is the law, and it exists to protect you.</p>
      <p>Verifying a licence takes two minutes. In New South Wales, you can check a contractor's licence on the NSW Fair Trading website. In Queensland, the QBCC (Queensland Building and Construction Commission) maintains a public register. Other states have equivalent systems. Simply search by name or licence number. If the tradie cannot give you a licence number, or if the number does not come up on the register, do not let them start work.</p>
      <p>An unlicensed tradie cannot provide a compliance certificate for work that legally requires one. That becomes your problem when you try to sell your home or make an insurance claim.</p>

      <h2>Check Insurance</h2>
      <p>A licence tells you a tradie is qualified. Insurance tells you you are protected if something goes wrong. There are two types of coverage to ask about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Public liability insurance</strong> — covers damage to your property or injury to a third party caused by the tradie's work. A minimum of $5 million cover is standard in the industry. If a tradie accidentally causes a fire, floods your home, or damages a neighbour's property, public liability insurance is what pays for it — not you.</li>
        <li><strong>Workers compensation</strong> — covers the tradie and any workers they employ if they are injured on your property. Without it, an injured worker could potentially pursue a claim against you as the homeowner.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ask to see a current certificate of currency for both policies before work starts. A legitimate tradesperson will have this documentation ready and will not hesitate to share it.</p>

      <h2>Read Local Reviews</h2>
      <p>Word of mouth has always been the best reference system for tradies, and in {{SUBURB}} that works both offline and online. Before hiring, do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check their Google Business profile for recent reviews. Look for consistent patterns rather than one or two outliers in either direction.</li>
        <li>Ask neighbours, family, or friends in {{SUBURB}} who they have used and would recommend. A tradie with a strong local reputation has something to protect.</li>
        <li>Look for how the business responds to negative reviews — a professional response to a complaint tells you more about how they handle problems than glowing praise from happy customers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Be cautious of businesses with no reviews at all, or with a sudden cluster of five-star reviews and nothing older than a few months.</p>

      <h2>Get It in Writing</h2>
      <p>A verbal agreement is worth nothing if a dispute arises. Before any tradie starts work at your {{SUBURB}} property, you should have a written quote or contract that includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A clear description of the work to be done</li>
        <li>The total price, broken down into labour, materials, and any fees</li>
        <li>The expected start date and completion timeframe</li>
        <li>Payment terms — when payment is due and what methods are accepted</li>
        <li>What happens if additional work is required (they should call you before proceeding)</li>
        <li>Any warranty on workmanship</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An email confirmation is acceptable as a written record. If a tradie will only give you a verbal price and wants to start immediately, that is a risk you should not take.</p>

      <h2>Local Matters More Than You Think</h2>
      <p>Choosing a tradie who is actually based in {{SUBURB}} — rather than one who operates from across town and services the area occasionally — has practical advantages that go beyond convenience. A locally based tradie can respond faster in an emergency, understands the specific conditions affecting properties in {{SUBURB}} (soil types, pipe ages, common local issues), and has a reputation in the community that they have every incentive to protect.</p>
      <p>When a problem arises after the job is done — and sometimes they do — a local tradie is far easier to reach and far more motivated to make it right than one who is never in your area again.</p>
