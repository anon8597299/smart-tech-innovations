      <h1>How to Choose a Financial Adviser in {{SUBURB}}: A Practical Guide</h1>
      <p class="meta">By {{BUSINESS_NAME}} &middot; {{SUBURB}}, {{STATE}} &middot; February 2026</p>

    <div class="article-body">
      <p>Choosing a financial adviser is one of the most important decisions you can make for your long-term financial wellbeing — yet many people do it with less rigour than they apply to choosing a new car. The quality of advice you receive will directly shape your retirement, your investment outcomes, and how well-protected you are when life takes unexpected turns. Here is a practical guide to finding the right adviser in {{SUBURB}}.</p>

      <h2>What to Look For in a Financial Adviser</h2>

      <h3>Australian Financial Services (AFS) Licence</h3>
      <p>In Australia, financial advisers must be authorised to provide advice under an Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence issued by ASIC (the Australian Securities and Investments Commission). You can verify any adviser's registration on the <strong>ASIC Financial Advisers Register</strong> — a free, publicly accessible database. Always check that the adviser you are considering is listed, is currently authorised, and has no adverse findings recorded against them.</p>

      <h3>Fee Structure — Transparent and Aligned</h3>
      <p>Understand exactly how your adviser is paid before you engage them. The primary models are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fee-for-service:</strong> You pay a flat fee or hourly rate for the advice itself, regardless of what products you are recommended. This is generally the most transparent model.</li>
        <li><strong>Asset-based fees:</strong> A percentage of your assets under management (typically 0.5%–1.5% per year). Can be fair for ongoing portfolio management, but be aware the fee grows as your portfolio grows — even if the work does not.</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid:</strong> A combination of the above.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry (2019), conflicted remuneration (such as trailing commissions on investment products) has been significantly restricted. However, it is still worth asking directly: "Do you or your firm receive any payments from product providers or platforms?" A trustworthy adviser will answer this clearly and completely.</p>

      <h3>Fiduciary Duty vs Best Interests Duty</h3>
      <p>Since 2013, licensed financial advisers in Australia have been subject to a <strong>best interests duty</strong> — they are legally required to act in your best interests when providing advice. This is a meaningful consumer protection, but it does not automatically mean all advice is equal in quality or independence. Ask your prospective adviser directly: "Are you tied to any particular product platforms or fund managers, or can you recommend from the entire market?"</p>

      <h3>Specialist vs Generalist</h3>
      <p>Some advisers are generalists who cover the full spectrum of personal finance. Others specialise — in retirement planning, self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs), risk insurance, or aged care advice. If your situation has a specific complexity (e.g., you are approaching retirement with a large super balance, or you are a business owner with a succession planning need), a specialist with deep experience in that area may serve you better than a generalist.</p>

      <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
      <p>Not every person who calls themselves a financial adviser will serve your interests well. Watch for these warning signs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commission-based conflicts:</strong> If an adviser earns a commission from a product they recommend (still possible in some insurance contexts), that creates a conflict of interest. Always ask how they are compensated for each recommendation.</li>
        <li><strong>Promises of specific returns:</strong> No legitimate adviser can guarantee investment returns. Anyone who does — especially unusually high ones — should be treated with extreme caution. This is a classic feature of investment fraud.</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure selling:</strong> A good adviser will encourage you to take time to review recommendations. If you are being pushed to sign documents or transfer funds quickly, without time to read and consider the advice, walk away.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of a Statement of Advice (SOA):</strong> Licensed advisers are required to provide a written SOA that sets out the advice, the basis for it, and the fees involved. Reluctance to provide one in writing is a red flag.</li>
        <li><strong>Not asking about your situation:</strong> Genuine personal advice requires a thorough understanding of your financial situation, goals, and needs. An adviser who makes recommendations without gathering this information is not providing advice — they are selling.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Questions to Ask at Your First Meeting</h2>
      <p>A first meeting with a financial adviser should be a conversation, not a presentation. Come prepared with these questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Are you registered with ASIC, and can I see your authorised representative number?</li>
        <li>How are you paid — fees, commissions, or a combination?</li>
        <li>Are you tied to a particular product platform or fund manager, or do you have open access to the market?</li>
        <li>What is your typical client profile, and do you have experience with clients in my situation?</li>
        <li>How often will we meet, and what does your ongoing service include?</li>
        <li>Will I receive a written Statement of Advice before any action is taken?</li>
        <li>Who will I be dealing with — you directly, or a junior associate?</li>
        <li>How do you handle complaints if I am not satisfied with your advice?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>A confident, experienced adviser will welcome these questions. Evasiveness or defensiveness is itself informative.</p>
