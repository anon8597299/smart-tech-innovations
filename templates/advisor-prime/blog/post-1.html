      <h1>Retirement Planning in {{SUBURB}}, {{STATE}}: When to Start and What to Consider</h1>
      <p class="meta">By {{BUSINESS_NAME}} &middot; {{SUBURB}}, {{STATE}} &middot; February 2026</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-body">
      <p>There is one rule in retirement planning that holds true regardless of your income, your age, or the state of the economy: the earlier you start, the less you need to contribute each year to reach the same outcome. That is not a sales pitch — it is mathematics. And for residents of {{SUBURB}} who are still in their 30s or 40s, it is genuinely good news.</p>

      <p>This guide walks through the key decisions you will face when building a retirement strategy, from understanding how compounding works in your favour to choosing the right contribution method for your circumstances.</p>

      <h2>The Compounding Advantage — Why 35 Beats 50</h2>
      <p>Compounding is the process of earning returns not just on your original contributions, but on the returns those contributions have already generated. Over long periods, the effect is dramatic.</p>
      <p>Consider two people who each want $800,000 in super at age 67. Person A starts contributing at 35 — they have 32 years of growth working for them. Assuming a long-run average return of 7% per annum, they need to contribute roughly $670 per month. Person B waits until 50 — they have only 17 years, and to reach the same target they need to contribute approximately $2,200 per month. Same destination, more than three times the monthly effort, simply because of a 15-year delay.</p>
      <p>The lesson is not that starting at 50 is hopeless — it is that every year of delay has a real, quantifiable cost. For those already in their 40s, the best time to act is now.</p>

      <h2>How Much Super Do You Actually Need?</h2>
      <p>A common reference point is the ASFA (Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia) Retirement Standard. For a <strong>comfortable retirement</strong> — one that allows for private health insurance, regular leisure activities, quality food, and occasional travel — the 2026 guide figures are approximately:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>$545,000</strong> for a single person</li>
        <li><strong>$640,000</strong> for a couple</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These figures assume you own your home outright and will receive a part Age Pension. If you rent, carry debt into retirement, or want a higher standard of living, your target will be higher. It is also worth noting that these are starting balances — your super continues to earn returns once you retire, meaning the pot does not simply drain at a flat rate.</p>
      <p>Working out your personal number requires factoring in your expected lifestyle costs, any other assets (investment properties, shares outside super), your age, and your projected super balance today.</p>

      <h2>Salary Sacrifice vs Personal Contributions</h2>
      <p>There are two primary ways to add extra money to your super beyond the mandatory Superannuation Guarantee (currently 11.5%): salary sacrifice and personal (after-tax) contributions.</p>
      <p><strong>Salary sacrifice</strong> means directing a portion of your pre-tax salary into super. These contributions are taxed at 15% inside the fund — significantly lower than most people's marginal income tax rate of 32.5% or above. This is one of the most tax-effective moves available to employed Australians.</p>
      <p><strong>Personal contributions</strong> are made from your after-tax income. You may be able to claim a tax deduction for these contributions (subject to eligibility), which effectively converts them into concessional contributions taxed at 15%. This can be useful for self-employed individuals or those whose employer does not offer salary sacrifice arrangements.</p>
      <p>Both approaches count toward your annual concessional contributions cap (currently $30,000 per year). If you have unused cap space from prior years and your super balance is below $500,000, you may also be able to carry forward and use that unused cap under the catch-up contribution rules.</p>

      <h2>Reviewing Your Investment Mix</h2>
      <p>Most Australians are in a default "balanced" super option — but that is not always the best fit for your situation. Your investment mix should reflect your age, risk tolerance, and how many years remain until retirement.</p>
      <p>A <strong>lifecycle approach</strong> is commonly recommended: higher growth exposure (Australian and international shares) in your 30s and 40s, gradually shifting toward more defensive assets (bonds, cash, infrastructure) as you approach retirement. Younger members can afford to ride out market downturns; those close to retirement cannot afford to have a significant correction wipe out a large portion of their balance right before they need to draw on it.</p>
      <p>Many funds now offer lifecycle or age-based investment options that adjust automatically. Alternatively, a financial adviser can help you construct a bespoke asset allocation aligned with your goals.</p>

      <h2>What About Property?</h2>
      <p>Many Australians instinctively reach for property as their retirement vehicle — and it is easy to see why. Australian property has delivered strong long-run returns, it is tangible, and it can generate rental income. However, it also comes with significant illiquidity, concentrated risk, and ongoing costs including maintenance, rates, and vacancy periods.</p>
      <p>Super, by contrast, is a tax-advantaged, diversified, and professionally managed structure. The concessional tax treatment inside super (15% on earnings, and just 10% on long-term capital gains) is difficult to replicate outside it. For many people, a combination of a paid-off family home plus a well-funded super balance is the most practical and resilient retirement strategy.</p>

      <h2>Getting Professional Advice Early</h2>
      <p>The cost of not getting advice is rarely visible — it shows up years later as a smaller balance, a more restricted retirement lifestyle, or the realisation that a straightforward strategy was available but never implemented. A quality financial adviser will help you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set a realistic, personalised retirement target</li>
        <li>Choose the right contribution strategy and contribution level</li>
        <li>Select an appropriate investment mix for your timeline</li>
        <li>Structure assets tax-efficiently inside and outside super</li>
        <li>Plan for insurance, estate planning, and aged care considerations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Good advice typically pays for itself many times over across a 20-to-30-year planning horizon.</p>
