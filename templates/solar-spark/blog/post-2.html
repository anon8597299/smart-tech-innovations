      <h1>Solar Rebates Available to {{SUBURB}} Homeowners in 2026</h1>
      <p class="meta">By {{BUSINESS_NAME}} &middot; January 2026 &middot; 5 min read</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-body">

      <p>A significant number of Australian homeowners who have gone solar — and many who are yet to make the switch — have not claimed every rebate and incentive they are entitled to. In some cases it is a lack of awareness; in others it is confusion about how the schemes work. For homeowners in {{SUBURB}}, the available support in 2026 can meaningfully reduce your upfront cost and shorten your payback period. Here is everything that is currently on the table.</p>

      <h2>Small-Scale Technology Certificates (STCs)</h2>
      <p>STCs are the core federal rebate for residential solar installations across Australia, and they apply to {{SUBURB}} homeowners regardless of which state you are in. The scheme works by assigning a number of certificates to your system based on its size, your postcode's solar zone rating, and the number of years remaining before the scheme phases down in 2031. Each certificate has a market value that fluctuates, but has generally sat in the <strong>$35–$40 range</strong> in recent years.</p>
      <p>For a 6.6 kW system in most parts of {{STATE}}, the STC rebate typically equates to a <strong>$2,500–$3,500 reduction</strong> off the installed price. This is applied directly as a point-of-sale discount — you never have to lodge paperwork or wait for a payment. Your accredited CEC installer creates and transfers the certificates on your behalf. The rebate decreases by one year's worth of certificates each January, so there is a genuine (though modest) financial advantage to installing sooner rather than later.</p>

      <h2>Feed-in Tariffs in {{STATE}}</h2>
      <p>A feed-in tariff (FiT) is the rate your electricity retailer pays for solar energy you generate but do not use yourself — the excess that flows back into the grid. In {{STATE}} in 2026, feed-in tariff rates vary by retailer, but the typical range for standard single-rate FiTs sits between <strong>4 and 10 cents per kilowatt-hour</strong>.</p>
      <p>To put that in context: you are likely paying 28–38 cents per kWh to buy electricity from the grid. This is why maximising self-consumption — using your solar as it is generated rather than exporting it — delivers far greater savings than relying on a high FiT. Time-shifting your dishwasher, pool pump, and washing machine to run during daylight hours is one of the simplest ways to improve your return. Your retailer comparison service can show you which providers in {{STATE}} are currently offering the best feed-in rates.</p>

      <h2>Interest-Free Loans and State Programs</h2>
      <p>Beyond the federal STC scheme, several state governments run programs that can further reduce the financial barrier to going solar. These programs change over time, but in recent years they have included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>New South Wales</strong> — the Empowering Homes program has offered interest-free loans for solar and battery systems for eligible households. Income thresholds and availability have varied by funding round.</li>
        <li><strong>Victoria</strong> — Solar Homes program rebates for solar panels, solar hot water systems, and battery storage, with a loan component available to some applicants.</li>
        <li><strong>Queensland</strong> — the Queensland Battery Booster and previous solar rebate schemes have supported lower-income households, with interest-free finance options for eligible residents.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Program availability, funding caps, and eligibility criteria change regularly. When you request a quote from {{BUSINESS_NAME}}, we will confirm which programs are currently active and whether your household qualifies.</p>

      <h2>Battery Rebates</h2>
      <p>Battery storage incentives have expanded significantly across Australia in recent years, driven by state governments seeking to build distributed grid resilience. Programs worth knowing about include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Virtual Power Plant (VPP) programs</strong> — several energy retailers and network operators run VPP schemes where you receive a discounted or subsidised battery in exchange for allowing the operator to draw on your battery's stored energy during peak grid demand periods. Participation fees are typically low and the battery discount can be substantial.</li>
        <li><strong>State battery rebates</strong> — Victoria's Solar Homes battery rebate and similar programs in other states offer direct rebates on battery installation, sometimes stacked with the STC scheme for the battery's inverter component.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Battery incentives in {{STATE}} are an evolving area. Ask us specifically about VPP opportunities and any current state rebates when you get in touch.</p>

      <h2>How to Claim — Who Does the Paperwork?</h2>
      <p>For most homeowners in {{SUBURB}}, the honest answer to "who handles the rebate paperwork?" is: <strong>your installer does it for you</strong>. The STC process is handled entirely by your Clean Energy Council (CEC) accredited installer, who creates the certificates on your behalf and assigns them to an agent in exchange for the point-of-sale discount. You do not fill out forms or wait for a government cheque.</p>
      <p>For state-based loan programs, you will typically need to complete a brief application — often a simple online form — and in some cases provide proof of income or ownership. Your installer should be able to guide you through this as part of the quote process.</p>
      <p>One important note: to access STCs and most state programs, your installer must be accredited by the Clean Energy Council. Always confirm your installer holds current CEC accreditation before signing anything.</p>
