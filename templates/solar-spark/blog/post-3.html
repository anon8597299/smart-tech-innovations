    <div class="article-body">

      <p>Every solar company in Australia has a version of the same marketing claim: "Save thousands on your power bills!" The problem is that claim is almost never attached to a specific household, a specific usage pattern, or an honest explanation of the assumptions behind it. This article is different. We are going to use real numbers — based on a typical {{SUBURB}} home with a 6.6 kW solar system — and show you exactly where the savings come from and what a reasonable 10-year projection looks like.</p>

      <h2>Understanding Your Electricity Bill</h2>
      <p>Before you can calculate solar savings, you need to understand the two key components of your current electricity costs. Your bill is made up of a <strong>daily supply charge</strong> (typically 80 cents to $1.20 per day regardless of how much you use) and a <strong>usage charge</strong> (the rate per kilowatt-hour for the electricity you consume). Solar does not reduce your supply charge — it reduces your usage charge by replacing grid electricity with self-generated power.</p>
      <p>Most households in {{SUBURB}} are on either a flat-rate tariff (typically 28–38 cents per kWh) or a time-of-use tariff (with peak rates of 40–55 cents in the evening, and off-peak rates around 15–18 cents overnight). The higher your usage tariff, the more valuable each kilowatt-hour of solar you consume directly. If you are on time-of-use pricing with high evening peak rates, self-consumption during the day is particularly valuable.</p>

      <h2>Typical Savings for a {{SUBURB}} Home</h2>
      <p>A 6.6 kW solar system installed in {{SUBURB}} will generate approximately <strong>9,500–10,500 kWh of electricity per year</strong> depending on roof orientation and panel quality. A typical four-person household uses 18–22 kWh per day, or roughly 6,500–8,000 kWh per year.</p>
      <p>The critical variable is self-consumption — how much of the solar you generate is actually used inside your home rather than exported to the grid at the much lower feed-in tariff rate. For a household that is home during the day or runs appliances on timers, a self-consumption rate of <strong>35–45%</strong> is realistic without a battery. Here is what that looks like in dollar terms at a grid tariff of 32 cents per kWh and a feed-in tariff of 7 cents per kWh:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Annual solar generation: 10,000 kWh</li>
        <li>Self-consumed (40%): 4,000 kWh &times; $0.32 = <strong>$1,280 saved on avoided grid purchases</strong></li>
        <li>Exported (60%): 6,000 kWh &times; $0.07 = <strong>$420 earned as feed-in credits</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Total annual benefit: approximately $1,700</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Households with pool pumps, air conditioning, or electric vehicle charging that can be shifted to daylight hours can comfortably exceed $2,000 per year in savings with the same system.</p>

      <h2>The Self-Consumption Equation</h2>
      <p>Self-consumption is the single biggest lever you have to improve your solar return, and it costs nothing to optimise. Every extra kilowatt-hour you consume directly from your solar — rather than exporting it for 7 cents and then buying it back for 32 cents — is worth an extra 25 cents in your pocket.</p>
      <p>Practical steps to maximise self-consumption in a {{SUBURB}} home:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Run the dishwasher, washing machine, and clothes dryer between 10am and 3pm on sunny days using delay-start timers.</li>
        <li>Set your pool pump to run during solar peak hours rather than overnight.</li>
        <li>Pre-cool or pre-heat your home using solar power in the afternoon before the evening peak.</li>
        <li>Charge an electric vehicle at home during the middle of the day.</li>
        <li>Switch to a solar diverter for your hot water system — excess solar that would otherwise be exported heats your water tank instead.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Adding a Battery — Does It Double Savings?</h2>
      <p>A home battery captures the solar you would otherwise export during the day and makes it available in the evening, lifting your self-consumption rate from 35–45% to approximately <strong>60–70%</strong>. In dollar terms for our example household above, that shift produces an additional <strong>$400–$600 per year</strong> in savings compared to solar alone.</p>
      <p>A quality 10 kWh home battery adds approximately $8,000–$10,000 to the installed cost. At $500 per year in additional savings, the battery's own payback period is around 16–20 years on financial grounds alone. This is why we are honest with {{SUBURB}} customers: if your primary goal is maximising financial return, optimise your self-consumption habits first. If you want energy independence, protection from blackouts, or you have a time-of-use tariff with very high peak rates, a battery has a stronger case.</p>

      <h2>10-Year Projection</h2>
      <p>Using our typical {{SUBURB}} household example — 6.6 kW system, 40% self-consumption, $1,700 first-year saving, and a 3% annual electricity price increase — here is what the 10-year return looks like:</p>

      <table class="savings-table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Year</th>
            <th>Annual Saving</th>
            <th>Cumulative Saving</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Year 1</td><td>$1,700</td><td>$1,700</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Year 2</td><td>$1,751</td><td>$3,451</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Year 3</td><td>$1,804</td><td>$5,255</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Year 4</td><td>$1,858</td><td>$7,113</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Year 5</td><td>$1,914</td><td>$9,027</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Year 6</td><td>$1,971</td><td>$10,998</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Year 7</td><td>$2,030</td><td>$13,028</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Year 8</td><td>$2,091</td><td>$15,119</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Year 9</td><td>$2,154</td><td>$17,273</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Year 10</td><td>$2,218</td><td>$19,491</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>On an installed cost of $6,000–$7,000 after the STC rebate, payback is comfortably achieved between years 4 and 5. The remaining 20-plus years of panel life deliver savings with no further capital outlay beyond routine inverter maintenance.</p>

      <h2>Every Month You Wait Is Money in the Retailer's Pocket</h2>
      <p>The numbers above represent money that is currently leaving your household and going to your electricity retailer every single quarter. A 6.6 kW solar system paying back $1,700 per year means that each month without solar is costing you approximately $140 in avoidable electricity costs. Over a 25-year panel life, the financial case for acting now rather than waiting is substantial.</p>
