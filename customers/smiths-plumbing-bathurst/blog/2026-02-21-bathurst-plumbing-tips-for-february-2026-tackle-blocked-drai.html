      <p>February in Bathurst brings scorching days and those unexpected summer storms, putting extra strain on your home's plumbing. At Smith's Plumbing, we've seen it all in the Central West – from **blocked drains** overflowing after heavy rain to hot water systems struggling in the heat. With plumbing industry growth hitting 2% annually and a push towards water-efficient upgrades, now's the perfect time to get your setup summer-ready. This guide shares practical, no-nonsense advice on common issues like blocked drains, hot water systems, gas fitting, and emergency callouts, tailored for Bathurst homes.</p><h2>Clearing Blocked Drains the Right Way in Bathurst</h2><p>Nothing ruins a Bathurst summer arvo like a **blocked drain** turning your backyard into a swamp. Heavy rain in the region often flushes leaves, grease, and debris into pipes, causing backups. Start with a plunger for minor clogs – fill the sink or tub with enough water to cover the plunger's bell, then plunge vigorously for 15-20 seconds. No luck? Skip the chemical drain cleaners; they can damage pipes and harm the environment.</p><p>Instead, grab a drain snake or plumber's auger from your local hardware store. Feed it into the drain, twist to break up the blockage, and pull out the gunk. For Bathurst's clay-heavy soils and tree roots invading sewers, hydro-jetting is a pro move – high-pressure water blasts clean without chemicals. Prevent future blocks by installing drain guards and pouring boiling water with bicarb soda down drains weekly. If it's a stubborn stormwater drain issue common after local downpours, call in the experts before it floods your laundry.</p><h2>Hot Water Systems: Beat the February Heatwave Hiccups</h2><p>With Bathurst temps climbing into the high 30s this February, a faltering **hot water system** means cold showers when you need them most. Australia's trending towards energy-efficient models like heat pump water heaters, which cut running costs by up to 60% using renewable air heat. Check your system's thermostat first – set it to 60°C for safety and efficiency, avoiding the bacteria risk above 65°C.</p><p>Flush sediment from your tank annually; in hard water areas like ours, buildup slashes performance. Turn off power, attach a hose to the drain valve, and flush until clear. Leaking valves? Tighten them or replace with plumber's tape. For upgrades, consider solar or gas instantaneous systems – perfect for Bathurst's sunny skies and aligning with green plumbing incentives. Signs it's time for a new unit: rusty water, strange noises, or bills spiking 20%+. Smith's Plumbing installs compliant models fast, saving you on energy amid rising costs.</p><h2>Gas Fitting and Emergency Callouts: Stay Safe This Summer</h2><p>**Gas fitting** demands precision, especially with Bathurst's older homes relying on LPG or natural gas for cooking and heating. Current trends favour PEX piping over copper for its corrosion resistance and flexibility in retrofits – ideal for kitchen renos popular this renovation boom. Always check for leaks with soapy water on joints; bubbles mean trouble. Never DIY gas lines – Australian standards require licensed pros to avoid explosions or carbon monoxide risks.</p><p>Emergencies don't wait for business hours, and February storms amplify **emergency callouts** for burst pipes or no-pressure issues. Spot a gusher? Shut off the main water valve immediately, then mop up and call us. For no hot water in a multi-point system, airlocks are common – bleed taps starting from the lowest. Smart leak detectors, now mainstream, alert your phone to save water and damage. In the Central West, where mining ops like nearby Ravensworth influence infrastructure, we're geared for quick response 24/7.</p><h2>Water-Smart Tips for Bathurst's Dry February</h2><p>Water conservation is huge in 2026, with smart systems and low-flow fixtures leading trends. Install aerators on taps to slash usage by 30% without losing pressure. Greywater diversion for garden irrigation suits our region perfectly. Touchless faucets prevent germ spread – handy post-flu season. Regular maintenance cuts waste: fix dripping taps (wasting 10L daily) and insulate hot pipes to retain heat.</p><p>Combine these with pro services for **blocked drains**, **hot water systems**, **gas fitting**, and **emergency callouts** to future-proof your home against efficiency standards tightening for projects like the 2032 Brisbane Olympics ripple effects.</p><p>Facing a plumbing drama in Bathurst this February?
