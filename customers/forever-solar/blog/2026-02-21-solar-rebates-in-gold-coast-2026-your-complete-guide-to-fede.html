      <p>If you're considering solar panels for your Gold Coast home, 2026 is genuinely one of the best times to make the move. Federal rebates remain strong, battery incentives have just been refreshed, and Queensland's abundant sunshine means your system will work hard for you. But with several rebate programs running simultaneously, it helps to understand exactly what's available and how to claim it.</p><p>Let's walk through the current landscape so you can make an informed decision about solar for your home.</p><h2>Federal Solar Rebates: The STC Scheme Still Works in Your Favour</h2><p>The main rebate available to Gold Coast homeowners is the federal Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES), commonly called the STC rebate. This isn't a government cheque you claim later—it's applied directly to your quote, reducing your upfront cost immediately.</p><p>Here's what you're looking at in 2026. A typical 6.6kW system (the most common residential size) attracts approximately <strong>$1,800 in federal rebates</strong>. If you're installing a larger 10kW system, you could see around <strong>$2,760</strong> knocked off the installed price. These figures vary slightly depending on your specific location within Gold Coast, as the STC value is influenced by your postcode's solar irradiance zone.</p><p>The key thing to know is that these rebates decline over time—they're stepping down every six months. So if you've been thinking about going solar, delaying means a smaller rebate on the same system. Your Forever Solar team can provide exact figures based on your address.</p><h2>Battery Storage: Timing Matters More Than Ever</h2><p>Queensland's battery rebate program has just been restructured, and if you're considering battery storage alongside your panels, the timing window is narrowing. From May 2026 onwards, battery rebates will be tiered by capacity, meaning larger batteries attract lower rebate percentages.</p><p>Right now, a typical 10–13kWh battery can still attract <strong>30–35% off the cost</strong>, often delivering $3,000–$5,000 in savings. That's substantial. A 10kWh battery is estimated to save around $3,108 at January 2026 rates.</p><p>If you're with Energex (Gold Coast's electricity distributor), battery storage becomes even more valuable. Pairing solar panels with a battery lets you store excess energy during the day and use it during peak evening hours when your Energex rates are highest. This compounds your savings beyond just the rebate itself.</p><h2>Feed-In Tariffs and Ongoing Savings</h2><p>Once your system is installed, you'll earn credits for excess solar energy fed back into the grid. In south-east Queensland—which includes Gold Coast—feed-in tariff rates are set by your electricity retailer and typically range between <strong>4c and 10c per kilowatt hour</strong>, depending on your provider.</p><p>This might not sound like much per unit, but across a year, it adds up. A well-positioned Gold Coast system generates significant surplus energy, especially during summer months. It's worth checking your current electricity provider's feed-in rate; some retailers offer better rates than others, and switching providers is straightforward if you find a better deal.</p><h2>Special Rebates Worth Considering</h2><p>Queensland has introduced a couple of additional incentives worth mentioning. The <strong>Supercharged Solar for Renters program</strong> provides landlords with rebates up to $3,500 for installing solar on rental properties—useful if you own investment properties in the Gold Coast area.</p><p>There's also a <strong>50% rebate (up to $2,000)</strong> available if you replace gas or wood-burning appliances with electric or solar-powered alternatives. If you're thinking about adding a solar hot water heat pump to your system, this could significantly reduce that cost.</p><p>Getting started is straightforward. The best first step is a free site assessment where your installer can evaluate your roof's solar potential, calculate your specific rebate entitlements, and show you real numbers based on your actual electricity usage and location. Gold Coast's consistent sunshine means most homes see excellent returns, but the specifics matter—shading, roof orientation, and your consumption patterns all play a role.</p><p>The federal rebates are stepping down, battery incentives are restructuring, and your Energex rates keep climbing. If solar has been on your mind, the maths favour acting sooner rather than later. Ready to maximise your solar savings on the Gold Coast?
