## CSS Tokens

```css
:root {
  --brand-primary: #5b4dff;
  --brand-primary-dark: #4c40db;
  --brand-accent: #2dd4bf;
  --brand-ink: #0f172a;
}
```

## Practical Usage Rules

- Keep **Primary** for action and directional cues (buttons, high-intent links).
- Use **Accent** sparingly for “wins” (results, performance, uplift).
- Reserve **Ink** for authority and readability (titles, dark sections, footers).
- Maintain strong contrast for accessibility; body text should remain highly legible.

## Campaign Alignment

This palette supports the core message:

> **"Your website is costing you money. Scan to find out."**

- Primary = urgency + action
- Accent = growth + outcome
- Ink = trust + professionalism
